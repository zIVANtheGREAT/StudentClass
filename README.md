This project is creating and exploring Classes within C++. 
creating classes helps encapsulate related data together and hides the data from unwanted manipulation
C++ also supports inheritance where you can have a superclass or base class and create a subclass or derived class 
where the subclass can inherit memeber functions and data members. More member functions and data members can 
be created within the subclass.
